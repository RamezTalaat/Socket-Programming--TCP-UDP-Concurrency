# Socket Programming : TCP/UDP Server Client Concurency
 This repo aims to clarify the difference Between TCP and UDP socket programming when hanlding concurrency.
 As shown in the TCP Example , i used thread to handle multiple connections for different clients as TCP is connection based
 But Threads were not needed in the UDP example as it does not need a connection at all.
